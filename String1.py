# A string is a sequence of characters that can be a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.
# It can be declared in python by using single quotes, double quotes, or even triple quotes.
# These quotes are not a part of a string, they define only starting and ending of the string.
# Strings are immutable, i.e., they cannot be changed.
# Each element of the string can be accessed using indexing or slicing operations.

# Assigning string to a variable
a = 'This is a string'
print(a)
b = "This is a string"
print(b)
c = '''This is a string'''
print(c)
